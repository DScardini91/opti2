    "You have to decide whether a pipeline is constructed between two nodes or not. A pipeline has a capacity and a cost to be opened (i.e, constructed). Once the pipeline is opened, you also have a cost for each unit of gas that is transported through this pipeline. Finally, there is a penalty for each unit of produced gas which is not consumed.\n",
